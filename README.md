<h3>What I've learned during this project</h3>
<ol>
  <li>While using only C++ classes to do this project, I've learned a lot about programming, but for the purpose of creating a game, Using a mix of Blueprints and C++ classes is way more efficient</li>
  <li>Making multiple builds of your game during development to ensure that everything is working properly once build</li>
  <li>Ensuring that everything is set up properly before starting the development process</li>
 
</ol>
